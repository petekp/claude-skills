- Never use IIFEs in React components.
- Always prefer easy-to-read code over clever code.
- Don't run the dev server unless there's a specific reason to do so. I typically run it myself outside Claude.
- Never add extraneous comments or comment markers to generated code. Code should be self-documenting.
