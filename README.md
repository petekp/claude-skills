## Skills

- `cognitive-foundations`<br>Grounds design decisions in HCI research: Fitts's Law, working memory limits, attention theory. The scientific "why" behind usability.

- `design-critique`<br>Structured UI feedback with severity levels (P0–P3), not vague opinions. Includes checklists and deep principles.

- `dreaming`<br>Suspends Claude's practical instincts. 10x questions, constraint-breaking, vision articulation. Includes good/bad output examples.

- `interaction-design`<br>Specific timing values, easing curves, state transitions. Grounded in direct manipulation theory.

- `model-first-reasoning`<br>Forces formal modeling before code. Entities, constraints, test oracles—then implementation. Prevents premature coding.

- `nextjs-boilerplate`<br>Opinionated setup: Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + assistant-ui. From zero to production-ready.

- `oss-product-manager`<br>Community dynamics, governance models, sustainability. Hard-won wisdom on building in the open.

- `startup-wisdom`<br>Cuts through startup BS. PMF signals, prioritization frameworks, founder mistakes by stage.

- `stress-testing`<br>Structured pre-mortems with kill criteria and assumption audits. Find flaws before they find you.

- `tutorial-writing`<br>Produces teaching documents, not code. Deep research → milestones → you implement. Stay connected to your work.

- `typography`<br>Specific values: line heights, modular scales, measure. Dark mode, accessibility. Not vague principles.

- `unix-macos-engineer`<br>macOS-specific expertise: launchd, defaults, Keychain, TCC. Plus defensive shell scripting.

- `ux-writing`<br>Patterns for every UI text situation. Error messages, empty states, button pairs. Quality tests included.

- `wise-novice`<br>Beginner's mind as a tool. Penetrating questions that cut through expert blind spots.
