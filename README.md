## Skills

### cognitive-foundations
Grounds design decisions in HCI research: Fitts's Law, working memory limits, attention theory. The scientific "why" behind usability.

### design-critique
Structured UI feedback with severity levels (P0–P3), not vague opinions. Includes checklists and deep principles.

### dreaming
Suspends Claude's practical instincts. 10x questions, constraint-breaking, vision articulation. Includes good/bad output examples.

### interaction-design
Specific timing values, easing curves, state transitions. Grounded in direct manipulation theory.

### model-first-reasoning
Forces formal modeling before code. Entities, constraints, test oracles—then implementation. Prevents premature coding.

### nextjs-boilerplate
Opinionated setup: Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + assistant-ui. From zero to production-ready.

### oss-product-manager
Community dynamics, governance models, sustainability. Hard-won wisdom on building in the open.

### startup-wisdom
Cuts through startup BS. PMF signals, prioritization frameworks, founder mistakes by stage.

### stress-testing
Structured pre-mortems with kill criteria and assumption audits. Find flaws before they find you.

### tutorial-writing
Produces teaching documents, not code. Deep research → milestones → you implement. Stay connected to your work.

### typography
Specific values: line heights, modular scales, measure. Dark mode, accessibility. Not vague principles.

### unix-macos-engineer
macOS-specific expertise: launchd, defaults, Keychain, TCC. Plus defensive shell scripting.

### ux-writing
Patterns for every UI text situation. Error messages, empty states, button pairs. Quality tests included.

### wise-novice
Beginner's mind as a tool. Penetrating questions that cut through expert blind spots.
